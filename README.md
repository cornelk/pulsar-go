A Go client library for the [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) project.

## Benefits over other Pulsar Go libraries

* Higher test coverage
* Pluggable logger interface

## Status

The library is in an early state of development, the API is not stable yet.
Any help or input is welcome.

## Alternative libraries

* [apache/pulsar-client-go](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go)
  the official Golang Client that inspired the creation of this alternative Client.

* [apache/pulsar/pulsar-client-go](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go)
  Cgo based Client library that will be deprecated.

* [Comcast/pulsar-client-go](https://github.com/Comcast/pulsar-client-go)
  an older Client that appears to not be maintained anymore and lacking features like Batching.
